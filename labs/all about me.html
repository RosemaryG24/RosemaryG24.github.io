<h2>before BECA </h2>
  <p> i was 14 before i came to beca, my life was just way better before beca because i met so many annoying people here especially this year . anyways i grew up in the bronx and attended at a elementary and middle school near my house until highschool .</p>
  
</h2>
<h2>during BECA</h2>
<p> During beca i was very quiet in my first year and didnt talk to anybody until the middle / end of the year . one of the friends i made in beca is adama , she transferred though . During beca i realized how strict and boring this school is . this year is pretty boring because i have class after class and have lunch last period . </p>
  


<h2>after BECA </h2>
<p> I cant really say much about after beca because im just in my 2nd year . but i plan to go to college and get a professional job but im not sure on what i want my career to be hopefully i figure it out . </p>

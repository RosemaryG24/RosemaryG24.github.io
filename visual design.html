	<p>I started thinking about things I like. I used the pencil tool and the type tool .
I just used some of my favorite albums and roses at the top because my nickname is rose .
It reflects that i'm a music lover .

<h2>Artifact statement</h2>
	<p>I used the grid perspective tool , rectangle tool , star tool and the type tool .
I used apartment buildings , a supermarket , a dentist building and a clinic and I used stars for the sky . 
The challenging part was adding the streets and aligning them .

<h2>Artifact statement</h2>
	<p>I used the selection tool to make this project . I used the selection tool to eliminate the parts of the face I didn't want . I used the scale and rotate tool . It was difficult for me to search for celebrities that look similar to me because I couldn't find any but I used Zendaya and 2 other people I didn't really recognize . I used Zendaya's face , brown eyes and lips with brown lipstick .</p>
